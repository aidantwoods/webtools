# wire2json
Easy conversion of exported semi-colon delimited cookies from Wireshark, to be imported into Edit this Cookie browser extension via required JSON format. wire2json.py expects format generated by right click context menu of cookies in Wireshark -> copy -> ...as Printable Text.

Most options don't need to be configured, but can be adjusted by obvious variable assignments given.
By default the domain, and the cookies require setting via input each time program is run. These too can of course be changed as convenient.

By default, file_output is set to false, so JSON will be output in the console. If needed, set this value to true to get a file instead.
The output file name is by default, 'cookies.json', but can easily be configured.

# jsChar2Code
Convert plaintext into String.fromCharCode(...) to be used in JavaScript. Run directly and type desired text into prompt, followed by enter, or simply pipe output in e.g: cat script.js | python3 jsChar2Code.py

Note: you should minify first â€“ dirt cheaply made script thus far, so first newline from piped text will be interpreted as end of input.
